// A graph is said to be bipartite if we can divide all its vertices into two mutually 
// exclusive and exhaustive sets such that none of the edge is within the set(i.e. all the 
//  edges of graph are across the sets)

/*
    1) A acyclic graph is always bipartite because we can easily put all the connected vertices
        into different sets.
    2) A cyclic graph with even number of vertices in the cycle is bipartite. This is because when we visit the cycle detection vertex, it would be at the same level in BFS.
    3) a cyclic graph with odd number of vertices in the cycle is always non-bipartite because in a BFS, we would visit the cycle detection vertex twice and each time this vertex would be at different levels in BFS.
